# README-Creator

## Description
This CLI application allows its user to quickly create a solid README file after answering
questions to some simple prompts by means of Node.js. After collecting user input via the inquirer
module, the users data is then stored and passed to the AXIOS module in order to obtain
licensing information from the GitHub API. Utilizing asynchronous functions, all of this
data is then compiled into a single markdown document that is organized and easily navigated
by any user.
